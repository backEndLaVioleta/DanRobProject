# Dan & Rob Project üçî ***BLOSSH*** üçî

###### Recipe DDBB

### What is BLOSSH?

In this project we are going to start an APP and DB that will hold the recipes and menu from [BLOSSH](https://www.blossh.com/)

[Dan](https://github.com/dan-dm) and [Rob](https://github.com/naranjito72) had decided to use MongoDB as their model for the DB

Raul wants us to have three entities:

  * Users 
  * Recipes
  * Menu

#### USERS 

Will have two roles: 

  * Admin
  * User

<ul>
  <li>User Info
    <ul>
      <li>_id: objectId</li>
      <li>firstName: string</li>
      <li>lastName: string</li>
      <li>email: string</li>
      <li>password: string</li>
      <li>role: string</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul> 

Admins will be loged in and authenticated by token. They can perform CRUD in both Recipes and Menu

Users won't need to be authenticated, but they'll only be able to read Recipes and menu

#### RECIPES

Collection will include:

<ul>
  <li>Recipes Info
    <ul>
      <li>_id: objectId</li>
      <li>name: string</li>
      <li>ingridients: array[]
        <ul>
          <li>_id: product id that will be the same as product collection. objectId</li>
          <li>name: string</li>
          <li>photo: string</li>
          <li>price: decimal (optional)</li>
        </ul>  
      </li>
      <li>photo: string</li>
      <li>preparation: string</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul> 

In this stage of the DB, we'll just shhow the recipes and preparation to the menu. 

Search engine. ___Need of discussion about the queries. Search for info with [*Algolia*](https://www.algolia.com)___

In thge large run, we'll love to make it linked and related to stock and cost price

#### MENU

***How many times do we cook grilled onions?. How many cakes we made this week?...*** 

These questions mean to be answered in the menu collection. Here will show the menu from the restaurant and, at least the first stage of the 

DB how many times a recipe has been used to do some of the items from the rest menu.

<ul>
  <li>menu Info
    <ul>
      <li>_id: objectId</li>
      <li>name: string</li>
      <li>recipes: array[]
        <ul>
          <li>_id: product id that will be the same as recipe collection. objectId</li>
          <li>nameRecipe: string</li>
        </ul>  
      </li>
      <li>photo: string</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul> 

#### GOALS

**First stage:**

> Admins able to do both Recipes and Menus CRUD
>
> Users able to read them
>
> search engine in recipes and menu
>
> When to cook the recipes
